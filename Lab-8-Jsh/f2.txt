     1	But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
     2	If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
     3	Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
     4	When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
