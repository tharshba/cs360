We'll get to know each other if we can 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
Maybe I can walk you home 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
I'd like to hold your little hand 
Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
