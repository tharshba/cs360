I'd like to hold your little hand 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
Maybe I can walk you home 
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
We'll get to know each other if we can 
solid life of crime
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands
feed me money for style
and i'll let you trip for a while
insecure from the past
how long can a good thing last?
