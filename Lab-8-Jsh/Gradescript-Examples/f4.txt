dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free
Soothing every wave that comes
Strolling slowly towards the sun
When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
