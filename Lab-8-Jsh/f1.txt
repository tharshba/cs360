Jocko homo
Are we not men? 
We'll get to know each other if we can 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
Maybe I can walk you home 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
I'd like to hold your little hand 
Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
